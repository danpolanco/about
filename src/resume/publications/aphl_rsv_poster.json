    "name": "Evaluation of RSV Genomic Diversity and Variant Prevalence Across Three Respiratory Seasons in Pediatric Cases in Colorado",
    "publisher": "APHL",
    "releaseDate": "2024-01-01",
    "summary": "Optimized WGS method and analyzed 674 distinct RSV samples using bioinformatics workflow. Evaluated prevalence of A and B subtypes and clades across three respiratory seasons, performing phylogenetic comparisons to determine circulating variants in Colorado over time. Demonstrated seasonal subtype alternation: B dominant in 2021, A in 2022, returning to B in 2023."
